# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Here we provided Louise with information in order to see if she has a chance of launching a succesful campaign for her upcoming play idea. We organized kickstarter information based on launch date and goals- as these are the parameters that we have from her. We not know that her $12k goal may be a little steep.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise determine when and how she should go about starting a campagin for her play. It may not guarantee a successful campaign, but it should increase her odds if she follows the data given. 
## Analysis and Challenges
It was fairly easy to perform the analysis for this project. The biggest challenge I had was getting the correct information on the chart for deliverable too. Remembering that not all the information was not needed for the analysis was what helped the most. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After a peak in May, there is a steady decline in successful plays launched. Late spring through the summer has the best odds of having a successful play. The later in the year, the likelyhood of a failed campaign rises.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When the campaign goal is less than $15k, there is always a higher chance of getting a successful play than not. Goals over $15k, the odds are stacked against you. Once you go over $40000 it is almost a waste of time. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was fairly easy to perform the analysis for this project. The biggest challenge I had was getting the correct information on the chart for deliverable too. Remembering that not all the information was not needed for the analysis was what helped the most.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The early summer (May-July) has the best chances of a successful launch of a play. After a peak in May, there is a steady decline for successful plays. Any given month, you have a higher chance of getting a successful play than failing. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Plays less than $5000 have the best odds of being successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We should have narrowed down the plays to only the ones that were launched in the country she lives in. Narrowing the data even further would give us a more clear picture of how chances of success with her campaign. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There should have been a graph based on outcomes, filtered by country. That would give us a better look at the odds of her project being a succsess or not. If we could add the month launched as well we would have a near perfect chart.
